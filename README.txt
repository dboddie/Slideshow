Basic Instructions
==================

Using images with limited 8 colour palettes and resolutions of 320x256 pixels
create data for display in MODE 1 with the make_picture.py tool. The data
files generated by this tool will be placed in the data directory.

To create a disk image and palette ROM, run the build-picture-disk.py tool,
specifying the paths to the data files and the file name of the disk image
to be created. For example:

  ./build-picture-disk -m 1 data/myimage.dat data/holiday.dat gallery.ssd

The palette ROM will be written to the palette.rom file.

To test the ROM and disk in Elkulator, run it in the following way:

  elkulator -rom1 palette.rom -disk gallery.ssd

Note that the ROM will fail if specified using the -rom2 command line option.
